name:                pipes-text
version:             0.0.0.4
synopsis:            Text pipes.
description:         Many of the pipes and other operations defined here mirror those in
                     the `pipes-bytestring` library. Folds like `length` and grouping 
                     operations like `lines` simply  adjust for the differences between 
                     `ByteString` and `Text` and `Word8` and `Char`. It is hoped that this
                     homogeneity will aid in learning the terms and programming style associated
                     with both of them.  
                     .
                     The most distinctive addition of the library to that core is the 
                     apparatus for encoding and decoding `Text` and `ByteString`.
                     .
                     Also defined are some simple functions akin to the `String` 
                     operations in `Pipes.Prelude`, and others like the utilities in `Data.Text`.  
                     .
                     All of the `IO` operations defined here - e.g `readFile`, `stdout` etc. 
                     - are conveniences akin to those in `Data.Text.IO` which e.g. try to 
                     find the system encoding and use the exceptions defined in the `text`
                     library. Proper `IO` in the sense of this library will employ 
                     `pipes-bytestring` in conjuntion with 'pure' operations like 
                     `decodeUtf8` and `encodeUtf8` that are defined here.
